# promoteME

PromoteMe is a web application that provides users the opportunity to set and track their progress towards goals at work. Employees will receive feedback from their managers and tips on how they can adapt to meet their goals faster. For each goal or achievement accomplished at work, employees will be rewarded badges to commemorate their hard work. Additionally, PromoteMe will provide resources for users to follow a defined path that will lead to better opportunities within the workplace.
