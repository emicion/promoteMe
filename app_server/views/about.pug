      h2 The Problem
      p
        |As it stands currently, most employees in the grocery industry do not show up to work with a clearly defined goal. The work culture that revolves around the industry does not focus on individual goals, rather it is focused on the overall goal of ever-increasing profits. The employeeâ€™s ability to find, set, and achieve individual goals takes a backseat to the overarching goal. This is the root of the problem. If employees continue to show up to work without defining their own goals, whether they are short-term or long-term, there will be a lack of motivation and engagement.
